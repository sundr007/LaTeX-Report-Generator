# LaTeX-Report-Generator
A small python based report generator for LaTeX.  It combs a file structure for valid input files like .txt .tex .png .jpg .csv .docx and compiles them all into a report generated by LaTeX.

A pdfLaTeX installation is required for use.

The look and feel of the generated report can be changed by modifying the TestStyle.sty file that LaTeX uses.  Alternatively, an entirely new test report folder can be added if multiple report types are desired.
